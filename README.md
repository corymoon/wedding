# Our Wedding Website
I'd previously built this website with Vue and Buefy, but got on a Svelte kick and decided to completely rebuild it. Obviously now built with Svelte and using Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI. Old website source is still available [here](https://github.com/corymoon/wedding-website-vue). Still uses Google Apps Script to submit email list form and RSVP form to Google Sheets.
